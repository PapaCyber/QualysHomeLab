# Qualys VM HomeLab
Qualys VM Scanning
<h2>Description</h2>
This is my first home lab project in existence. I will be using Windows 10 on a virtual machine. I will install a deprecated version of Mozilla Firefox and VLC media player and use a Qualys Virtual Scanner Appliance to scan the environment for vulnerabilities. After I scan for vulnerabilities, after the scan I will review the report and make an assessment. I will remediate the vulnerabilities and verify that these vulnerabilities are removed.
